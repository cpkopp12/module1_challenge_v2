# module1_challenge_v2

This is my submission for the first challenge! I tried to comment anywhere that I changed the original code. As I described the assignmet submission there
are no recorded commits in this repository because I had initialized git in the wrong directory, which gave me problems when I tried to publish the site.
A link to the original repository submitted with the rest of my assignment.
